# OSSC19 Crowdsourced Replication Initiative

[Robert Myles McDonnell](https://robertmylesmcdonnell.netlify.com/) and [I](http://danilofreire.com) are participating in the [OSSC19 Crowdsourced Replication Initiative](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/openscience/index.php/crowdsourced-replication-initiative/). The initiative consists of a crowdsourced replication and extension of a study about the impact of immigration on public opinions. The project is coordinated by [Nate Breznau](https://sites.google.com/site/nbreznau/) and we are happy to be part of it! 

In the spirit of open science, we are making all our research steps available on this repository. The original dataset and other auxiliary files are included in the [CRI Shared Data Folder](https://github.com/danilofreire/crowdsourced-replication-iniciative/tree/master/CRI%20Shared%20Data%20Folder). Our data files are in the [data]() folder and the `R` scripts are, predictably, in the [`R`]() folder. We used the great [`jetpack` package](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack) for `R` to make sure our analyses are reproducible. Let's see what we find! :bowtie: :books: :microscope: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
